	Our research is focused on developing and employing quantitative techniques—from super-resolution imaging (PALM and STORM) to micro/nanofabrication technologies to high resolution genomic analysis—to analyze single cells. Examples of projects we have running in the lab are:

		%li.span7
			Node-Pore Sensing (NPS), a label-free technique that can screen for multiple markers on the surface of cells. We are using NPS to
			%ul
				%li 
					identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in whole blood
				%li
					screen and isolate the minute stem-cell population (5-10 satellite cells) directly from a single-muscle fiber niche
				%li
					create a point-of-care diagnostic tool to identify acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)

		%li.span8
			Understanding dramatic postnatal decline in regenerative capacity in mammals. Here, we are performing single-cell analysis of the blastema cells we have isolated from the point of amputation of a mouse digit.
	%li
		Investigating how breast-cancer stem cells interact with their microenvironments. We are creating microfluidic devices that will allow us to culture isolated breast-cancer tumor initiating cells whilst introducing an array of complex chemical and mechanical cues.

	We are active members of the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3) and the Berkeley Stem Cell Center, with students in several departments including the UC Berkeley-UCSF Graduate Group in Bioengineering, Berkeley’s Biophysics Graduate Group, and Mechanical Engineering.
